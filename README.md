**Network and Computer Security**

# Project

This document describes the organization of the project for the Network and Computer Security / Segurança Informática em Redes e Sistemas (SIRS) course.

You will work in a team of 3 members.

The scenarios for the project are described in another document, which will be posted on the course web site.

Read the scenario descriptions and, as a team, sort the topics by preference for doing your work.

When the selection form opens, sort all the scenarios by order of preference and submit.
Number 1 will be your most preferred topic.

Each team should be represented by one student only.
In the selection form, identify your team as `CXX`, where `C` is replaced by A(lameda) or T(aguspark) and `XX` is replaced by the two digits of your group number, as assigned by Fénix.
For example, group 22 of Taguspark is T22 and group 7 of Alameda is A07.

To assure topic diversity, there are limited vacancies for each project scenario.
Slots will be assigned on a _first-come-first-served_ basis using the submitted preferences.

The official topic selection list will be posted after the process is concluded, to confirm the topic assigned to each group.  
If your team did not get its first choice, do not worry, as all scenarios have challenges to solve!

We wish you all the best in this technical venture!  
Make the most of it and ask for our feedback as much as possible.
A security project that receives regular feedback can be improved earlier and is more likely to achieve a better result.
